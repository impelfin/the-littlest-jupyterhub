# Installing on Digital Ocean

## Goal

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a JupyterHub with some admin
users and a user environment with packages you want installed running on
[DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com).

## Pre-requisites

1. A DigitalOcean account with a payment method attached.

## Step 1: Installing The Littlest JupyterHub

Let's create the server on which we can run JupyterHub.

1.  Log in to [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com). You might need to
    attach a credit card or other payment method to your account before you
    can proceed with the tutorial.

2.  Click the **Create** button on the top right, and select **Droplets** from
    the dropdown menu. DigitalOcean calls servers **droplets**.

    ```{image} ../images/providers/digitalocean/create-menu.png
    :alt: Dropdown menu on clicking 'create' in top right corner
    ```

    This takes you to a page titled **Create Droplets** that lets you configure
    your server.

3.  Under **Choose an image**, select **22.04 x64** under **Ubuntu**.

    ```{image} ../images/providers/digitalocean/select-image.png
    :alt: Select 22.04 x64 image under Ubuntu
    ```

4.  Under **Choose a size**, select the size of the server you want. The default
    (4GB RAM, 2CPUs, 24 USD / month) is not a bad start. You can resize your server
    later if you need.

    Check out our guide on How To [](/howto/admin/resource-estimation) to help pick
    how much Memory, CPU & disk space your server needs.

5.  Open the **Advanced Options**, and check the box for **Add Initialization scripts**.

    ```{image} ../images/providers/digitalocean/additional-options.png
    :alt: Turn on User Data in advanced options
    ```

    This opens up a textbox where you can enter a script that will be run
    when the server is created. We will use this to set up The Littlest JupyterHub
    on this server.

6.  Copy the text below, and paste it into the user data text box. Replace
    `<admin-user-name>` with the name of the first **admin user** for this
    JupyterHub. This admin user can log in after the JupyterHub is set up, and
    can configure it to their needs. **Remember to add your username**!

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -L https://tljh.jupyter.org/bootstrap.py \
      | sudo python3 - \
        --admin <admin-user-name>
    ```

    :::{note}
    See [](/topic/installer-actions) if you want to understand exactly what the installer is doing.
    [](/topic/customizing-installer) documents other options that can be passed to the installer.
    :::

7.  Under the **Finalize and create** section, enter a `hostname` that descriptively
    identifies this server for you.

    ```{image} ../images/providers/digitalocean/hostname.png
    :alt: Select suitable hostname for your server
    ```

8.  Click the **Create** button! You will be taken to a different screen,
    where you can see progress of your server being created.

    ```{image} ../images/providers/digitalocean/server-create-wait.png
    :alt: Server being created
    ```

9.  In a few seconds your server will be created, and you can see the **public IP**
    used to access it.

    ```{image} ../images/providers/digitalocean/server-create-done.png
    :alt: Server finished creating, public IP available
    ```

10. The Littlest JupyterHub is now installing in the background on your new server.
    It takes around 5-10 minutes for this installation to complete.

11. Check if the installation is complete by copying the **public ip**
    of your server, and trying to access it with a browser. This will fail until
    the installation is complete, so be patient.

12. When the installation is complete, it should give you a JupyterHub login page.

    ```{image} ../images/first-login.png
    :alt: JupyterHub log-in page
    ```

13. Login using the **admin user name** you used in step 6, and a password. Use a
    strong password & note it down somewhere, since this will be the password for
    the admin user account from now on.

14. Congratulations, you have a running working JupyterHub!

## Step 2: Adding more users

```{include} add-users.md

```

## Step 3: Install conda / pip packages for all users

```{include} add-packages.md

```
