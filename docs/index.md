# The Littlest JupyterHub

A simple [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) distribution for
a small (0-100) number of users on a single server. We recommend reading
[](/topic/whentouse) to determine if this is the right tool for you.

## Development Status

This project is currently in **beta** state. Folks have been using installations
of TLJH for more than a year now to great success. While we try hard not to, we
might still make breaking changes that have no clear upgrade pathway.

## Installation

The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) can run on any server that is running **Debian 11** or **Ubuntu 20.04** or **22.04** on an amd64 or arm64 CPU architecture.
We aim to support 'stable' and Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.
Newer versions are likely to work with little or no adjustment, but these are not officially supported or tested.
Earlier versions of Ubuntu and Debian are not supported, nor are other Linux distributions.
We have a bunch of tutorials to get you started.

- Tutorials to create a new server from scratch on a cloud provider & run TLJH
  on it. These are **recommended** if you do not have much experience setting up
  servers.

Once you are ready to run your server for real,
it's a good idea to proceed directly to {doc}`howto/admin/https`.
