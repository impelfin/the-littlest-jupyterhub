## Increasing your boot disk size

Boot disks contain the operating system and boot loader for your TLJH instance. If you followed
the [Google Cloud TLJH installation instructions](#install-google) then you created a virtual machine
with one disk: a boot disk that will _also_ be used to hold user data in your hub. For various reasons
you may need to change your boot disk size.

Google Cloud Compute Engine supports _increasing_ (but not _decreasing_) the size of existing disks.
If you selected a boot disk with a supported version of **Ubuntu** or **Debian** as the operating
system, then your boot disk can be resized easily from the console with these steps.

:::{note}
Google Cloud resizes the root partition and file system for _boot_ disks with _public_ images
(such as the TLJH supported **Ubuntu** and **Debian** images) automatically after your increase
the size of your disk. If you have any other _non-boot_ disks attached to your instance, you
will need to perform extra steps yourself after resizing your disk. For more information on
this and other aspects of resizing persistent disks, see
[Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/resize-persistent-disk).
:::

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console -> Compute Engine -> VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) and select your TLJH instance.

1. Scroll down until you find your boot disk and select it.

1. Select **Edit** in the top menu. This may require selecting the kebab menu (the 3 vertical dots).

1. Update the **Size** property and save the changes at the bottom of the page.

   ```

1. Reboot the VM instance by logging into your TLJH, opening the terminal, and running `sudo reboot`.
   You will lose your connection to the instance while it restarts. Once it comes back up, your disk
   will reflect your changes. You can verify that the automatic resize of your root partition and
   file system took place by running `df -h` in the terminal, which will show the size of the disk
   mounted on `/`:
   ```bash
   $ df -h
   Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
   /dev/root        25G  6.9G   18G  28% /
   tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm
   tmpfs           785M  956K  784M   1% /run
   tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
   /dev/sda15      105M  6.1M   99M   6% /boot/efi
   ```
