# Configure resources available to users

To configure the resources that are available to your users (such as
RAM, CPU and Disk Space), see the section [](#tljh-set-user-limits).
For information on **resizing** the environment available to users _after_ you\'ve created
your JupyterHub, see [](#howto-admin-resize).
